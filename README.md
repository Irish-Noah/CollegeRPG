# CollegeRPG
I am currently in a class that is teaching me how to create my own applications. I wanted to use what I have learned in my course to try to develop my own roleplay game. CollegeRPG focuses on the aspects of the college experience. I am unsure how far I will get with this project, but I want to accomplish three tasks.

1) Learn more about the wxWidgets library in respects to application design.
2) Learn how the backend of applications relate to the frontend of the application.
3) Learn how manage a project over multiple computers using GIT.

Therefore, the main goal of this projects is to gain experience of the knowledge I have accumulated in class!
